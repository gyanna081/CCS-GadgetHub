NAME: MICA ELLA B. OBESO
COURSE & YEAR: BSIT-4

I’m Mica Ella Obeso, but most people just call me Mica. Singing and dancing are my passions—they bring me so much joy and allow me to express myself freely. I absolutely love animals, especially cats and dogs, and I cherish the happiness they bring. People who don’t know me sometimes think I’m intimidating, but in reality, I’m a happy and friendly person who loves to laugh and connect with others. I enjoy spreading positivity, embracing creativity, and making meaningful memories with the people around me.
