<strong>COURSE & YEAR:</strong> <u>BSIT-4</u> <br><br>  

<p><strong>I’m Mica Ella Obeso</strong>, but most people just call me <strong>Mica</strong>.  
<em>Singing and dancing are my passions</em>—they bring me so much joy and allow me to express myself freely.  
I absolutely <strong>love animals</strong>, especially <u>cats</u> and <u>dogs</u>, and I cherish the happiness they bring.  

People who don’t know me sometimes think I’m <em>intimidating</em>, but in reality,  
I’m a <strong>happy and friendly person</strong> who loves to laugh and connect with others.  
I enjoy <strong>spreading positivity</strong>, <strong>embracing creativity</strong>, and <strong>making meaningful memories</strong> with the people around me.</p>
