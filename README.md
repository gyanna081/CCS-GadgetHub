I enjoy staying active through swimming, biking, and running—these sports are a big part of my lifestyle. Alongside my passion for fitness, I’m also a devoted cat lover; they bring so much happiness and comfort to my life. Whether I'm pushing my limits in training or unwinding with my cat, I always strive to maintain a balance between adventure and relaxation. I love taking on new challenges, embracing both the thrill of competition and the simple joys of everyday life.
